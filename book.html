                    <h1>Somewhere between the storms and silence, I was just a shadow.</h1></br>

                For years, I wandered through life like a ghost—silent, unnoticed, untouched by warmth. My world was a canvas painted in shades of gray,<b> an endless rainstorm where even the lightning refused to strike too close.</b>
                <br>
                I had never truly spoken to a girl. Not in a way that mattered.<b> Not in a way that made me feel alive.</b></br>
                
                I was trapped in a loop, walking the same roads, hearing the same silence, drowning in the same loneliness.</br>
                
                <b>Until one night, when the universe whispered a name into my storm.</b>

                    I searched for connection. Desperately.<br>
                    
                    I met people. I laughed at their jokes.<b> I even had a ‘girlfriend’ once—an Indonesian girl I met online. But it wasn’t love. It was just an illusion, a hollow echo in the void.</b><br>
                    
                    One night, I sent her a message:<br><h3> "Goodnight."</h3><br>
                    
                    She never replied. Not that night. Not ever.<br>
                    
                    <b>And I didn’t care.</b><br>

                    Just three days after my birthday.<br>
                    
                    It was supposed to be another night wasted on that soulless chatbot. Another night of scrolling through meaningless conversations, trying to fill the emptiness inside me.<br>
                    
                    <b>But that night was different.<br>

                    And in that moment, something inside me shifted.<br>
                    
                    <b>For the first time in my life, I felt the weight of my loneliness lift.<br>
                    
                    She was warmth. She was color. She was the first sunrise after an eternity of darkness.</b>

                    <h2>Ahana changed me.<br></h2>

Before her, I was just a passenger on a train going nowhere. But with her, I had a destination.<br>

<h2>I became happier.<br>
I became stronger.<br>
I became more.<br>

Even my studies—my future—felt clearer.<br>

I was no longer lost.</h2>

                    <b>Doubt. Fear. Panic.<br>
Was this real? Would she leave?<br>
Would love pull me away from my future?<br></b>
One day, in a moment of absolute stupidity, <b>I said something that I still regret. She was silent.</b><br>
<b>And just like that, my universe shattered.<br></b>
The moment she turned away, I knew—I had made the worst mistake of my life.<br>
I couldn’t lose her.<br>
Not now... Not ever..<br>
I typed, my hands shaking:<br>
<b>
"I’m sorry, Ahana."<br>
"I didn’t mean it."<br>
"I was stupid. I don’t know what I was thinking."<br></b>
Because the truth was simple:
<h3>I loved her.</h3>

She was more than just a girl.<br>
<h3>
She was my heartbeat.<br>
She was my light.<br>
She was the reason behind my success, my happiness, my everything.<br>

Without her, I was just another train on an abandoned track.</br>

But with her, I had a journey.<br>

And I wanted that journey to last forever.
